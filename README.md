## Project Overview
This project analyzes trends in energy consumption across various sectors in the U.S., with a particular focus on the growing importance of renewable energy sources. Using datasets from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), we examine the shift from fossil fuels to renewables, regional disparities in energy production and consumption, and the corresponding impact on CO2 emissions.

## Key Objectives
- Identify current trends in renewable energy consumption
- Examine how these trends impact CO2 emissions
- Highlight regions with high fossil fuel consumption where transition to renewables could be beneficial
- Explore possible strategies for optimizing energy efficiency across the U.S.

## Data Sources
All data is sourced from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA):
- [Total Energy Browser](https://www.eia.gov/opendata/browser/total-energy)
- [Renewable Energy Data](https://www.eia.gov/renewable/data.php#summary)
- [CO2 Emissions Data](https://www.eia.gov/opendata/browser/co2-emissions/co2-emissions-and-carbon-coefficients)
- [Monthly Energy Data](https://www.eia.gov/totalenergy/data/monthly/)
- [State Energy Data](https://www.eia.gov/state/?sid=US)
- [SEDS Complete Data](https://www.eia.gov/state/seds/seds-data-complete.php)

## Key Findings

### 1. Energy Production Trends (1990-2022)
- Natural gas has emerged as the dominant energy source since early 2000s
- Coal production has steadily declined
- Renewable energy has shown exponential growth, especially since 2010

### 2. State-Level Analysis
- Texas leads in total energy production and consumption
- Western states (California, Oregon, Washington) are pioneers in renewable energy
- Midwest states like Iowa and Kansas are significant wind energy producers

### 3. Environmental Impact
- Clear link established between energy production and CO2 emissions
- Decline in coal production and rise of natural gas and renewables have helped slow emissions growth
- Renewable energy growth since 2015 shows promising path toward reducing carbon footprint
