# Navigating the Energy Landscape: A Visual Analytics Study

## Overview
A comprehensive visual analytics study of the U.S. energy landscape using Tableau, focusing on energy consumption patterns, renewable energy adoption, and environmental impacts across states. The analysis leverages data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) to provide actionable insights into energy trends and sustainability metrics.

## Project Objectives
- Analyze state-level energy consumption patterns and trends
- Evaluate renewable energy adoption rates across different regions
- Assess environmental impacts through CO2 emissions analysis
- Identify correlations between energy consumption and economic factors

## Data Sources
All data is sourced from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA):
- [Total Energy Data](https://www.eia.gov/opendata/browser/total-energy)
- [Renewable Energy Data](https://www.eia.gov/renewable/data.php#summary)
- [CO2 Emissions Data](https://www.eia.gov/opendata/browser/co2-emissions/co2-emissions-and-carbon-coefficients)
- [Monthly Energy Data](https://www.eia.gov/totalenergy/data/monthly/)
- [State Energy Data System (SEDS)](https://www.eia.gov/state/seds/seds-data-complete.php)
